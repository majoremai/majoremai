## Hey, I'm Shola✌🏾
#### Where data meets design — and strategy speaks 

<small>Currently building **[Majórem.ai](http://majorem.ai/)**, a consulting venture that helps organisations cut through noise and turn complexity into clarity.

Through data visualisation, commercial storytelling, and AI-driven insight, we focus on ROI, efficiency, and impact. On GitHub I share calculation blueprints, viz design experiments, and planning frameworks that reflect both our client work and my journey in shaping data into actionable strategy.</small>
